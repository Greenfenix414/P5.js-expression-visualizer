# P5.js-expression-visualizer
Kind of an odd name but the basic gist is: it
takes the pixels on screen, and you can change the 
color depending on the x and y, or ju
st use completely different values!
its a pretty basic project that I was messing around with, so I decided to polish it
a bit and make it an addon for p5.js. :)
